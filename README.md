## Simple scoring software for PROQ2, PROQ3 and CREOQ3 questionnaires.

PROQ and CREOQ are measures of relating and interrelating developed by Dr John Birtchnell.

To use the software first download it as a Zip file, extract the contents and then open index.html in any modern web browser. Alternatively you may upload the code to a web server to make the software available to use on-line.

### About the measures

##### The Person's Relating to Others Questionnaire (PROQ)

The PROQ (as distinct from the PROQ2) was the earliest relating measure and was described in Birtchnell, Falkowski & Steffert (1992). It was later described in Chapter 9 of both How Humans Relate (Birtchnell, 1993/6) and Relating in Psychotherapy (Birtchnell, 1999/2002). It is a 96-item, self-administered questionnaire, with twelve items contributing to each of the eight scales, which correspond to each octant of the interpersonal octagon. Of the twelve items, two refer to positive relating, and are not normally scored, and ten refer to negative relating. The positive items are included to give respondents something good to say about themselves. There are four options for each item providing a score range of 0-3. Thus for each octant scale, the score range is 0-30, and the total score, combining the scores for each scale has a maximum of 240.

##### The PROQ2

In 1995, a revised version of the PROQ was produced, called the PROQ2. Its aims were to improve the clarity and factorial structure and to reduce the correlation between scales. The wording of the response options was changed to "Nearly always true" "Quite often true" "Sometimes true" and "Rarely true." Since the introduction of the PROQ2, the original PROQ has dropped out of use. The Birtchnell, Falkowski & Steffert (1992) paper is the only one on the original PROQ; and at present, the only paper on the PROQ2 is the one by Birtchnell & Shine (2000). The 1992 paper contains the items of the PROQ. The items of the PROQ2 have not been published, but copies of the PROQ2 are available from me.

The scales of the PROQ and the PROQ2, named after the octants of the interpersonal octagon, are called upper neutral (UN), upper close (UC), neutral close (NC), lower close (LC), lower neutral (LN), lower distant (LD), neutral distant (ND) and upper distant (UD).

##### The PROQ2a and PROQ3

These two measures are attempts to produce a shortened version of the PROQ2. Both are half the length of the PROQ2, i.e. they have 48 items, six for each octant. Five of these six items are negative and one is positive. The PROQ2a is made up entirely of items from the PROQ2, whereas the PROQ3 includes some new items. The PROQ2a items comprise those with the highest loadings on the eight factors that emerged from a principal components analysis of the PROQ2 items and with the lowest commonalities. In the PROQ3, all of the UC items, and some of the LD items have been replaced. The point of this is to render the UC scale more pathological and to reduce the high correlation between the LD scale and the LN scale.
 

##### The Couple's Relating to Each Other Questionnaires (CREOQ)

The interrelating between two people can be measured by a set of questionnaires called the Couple's Relating to Each Other Questionnaires (CREOQ). These were first developed for the measurement of the interrelating between two people in a couple relationship. They can however be modified to measure the interrelating between any two specified people. The CREOQ is made up of a set of four questionnaires called the MS, MP, WS and WP. The MS measures how the man considers he relates to the woman, the MP measures how the man considers the woman relates to him, the WS measures how the woman considers she relates to the man and the WP measures how the woman considers the man relates to her. As with the PROQ, each of the four questionnaires has 96 items, 12 for each of the eight octants. Again, ten of these concern negative relating and two concern positive relating. 

##### The CREOQ3

On the basis of an exploratory factor analysis, a shorter version of the CREOQ, with only 48 items compared with the original 96, for each of the four scales, MS, MP, WS and WP, was created. As with the CREOQ, the items for the MS, and the WS and for the MP and the WP, are identical apart from gender words. It is made up of those items with the heaviest loadings on the extracted factors, though excludes items loaded on more than one factor. A number of new items were introduced in order to more clearly differentiate between certain neighbouring scales (e.g. UN and UD). This new version is called the CREOQ3, so as to be comparable with the PROQ3 (though there never was a CREOQ2).






## Manual scoring instructions.
To score questionnaires manually rather than using the software provided the following instructions may be used.
 
##### PROQ2

Each question can contribute from zero to three points to one of the scores,

Nearly always true = 3 points
Quite often true = 2 Points
Sometimes true = 1 Point
Rarely True = 0 Points

The table below shows the eight negative and eight positive scores.
Listed next to each score are the question numbers of each question that contributes to that score, there are 10 questions that contribute to each negative score giving a total of between 0 and 30 points for each score, and 2 questions that contribute to each positive score giving a total of between 0 and 6 points each.
